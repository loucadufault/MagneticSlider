# MagneticSlider
A lightweight, spec-compliant extension of [@material-ui](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui)'s Slider component, that enables the slider thumb to be attracted to the marks by a finely-configurable magnetic force.

See the [Slider component](https://material-ui.com/components/slider/) and [Slider API](https://material-ui.com/api/slider/) documentation.
