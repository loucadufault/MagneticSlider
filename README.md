# MagneticSlider

A lightweight, spec-compliant extension of [material-ui](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui)'s Slider component, that enables the slider thumb to be attracted to the marks by a finely-configurable magnetic force. 

No dependencies, aside from [React](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react) and [@material-ui/core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@material-ui/core), of course.

See the [Slider component](https://material-ui.com/components/slider/) and [Slider API](https://material-ui.com/api/slider/) documentation.

Inspired by [this StackOverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62872477/material-ui-range-slider-make-the-thumb-snap-to-a-value-when-its-vicinity) and [its sole answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/62879241) by SO user [Shreya](https://stackoverflow.com/users/10789616/shreya).
